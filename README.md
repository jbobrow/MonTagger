# MonTagger
Drawing loose inspiration from Fahrenheit 451's protagonist, Guy Montag, MonTagger is a device + software for saving graffiti art or tags that might otherwise be erase from sight and memory. The software portion interprets a pair of laser lines projected onto the tagged surface, and determines position as well as rotation of the tagging device. While MonTagger ("My Tagger"), projects these orthogonal lines, let's call the software "Granger," as it will record all that its eyes can see.
